## Installation

> **Note:** Package is available on npm but in alpha stage

```bash
npm install @nflverse/nflreadts
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {
  loadPbp,
  loadPlayerStats,
  loadParticipation,
  loadRosters,
  loadPlayers,
  loadDepthCharts
} from '@nflverse/nflreadts';

// Load play-by-play data for 2023 season
const plays = await loadPbp(2023);
console.log(`Loaded ${plays.length} plays`);

// Load player stats with weekly breakdown
const weeklyStats = await loadPlayerStats(2023, { summaryLevel: 'week' });

// Load player stats aggregated for regular season
const regStats = await loadPlayerStats(2023, { summaryLevel: 'reg' });

// Load participation/snap count data (2016+)
const participation = await loadParticipation(2023);

// Load season rosters (1920+)
const rosters = await loadRosters(2023);
console.log(`Loaded ${rosters.length} roster entries`);

// Load all-time player database
const players = await loadPlayers();
console.log(`Loaded ${players.length} players`);

// Load weekly depth charts (2001+)
const depthCharts = await loadDepthCharts(2023);

// Load multiple seasons in parallel
const multiSeasonPbp = await loadPbp([2022, 2023]);
const multiSeasonRosters = await loadRosters([2022, 2023]);

// Load all available seasons
const allPbp = await loadPbp(true);

// Use Parquet format for better performance
const parquetPbp = await loadPbp(2023, { format: 'parquet' });
const parquetRosters = await loadRosters(2023, { format: 'parquet' });
```
