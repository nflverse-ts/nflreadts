## Installation

> **Note:** Package is available on npm but in alpha stage

```bash
npm install @nflverse/nflreadts
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { loadPbp, loadPlayerStats, loadParticipation } from '@nflverse/nflreadts';

// Load play-by-play data for 2023 season
const pbpResult = await loadPbp(2023);
if (pbpResult.ok) {
  const plays = pbpResult.value;
  console.log(`Loaded ${plays.length} plays`);
}

// Load player stats with weekly breakdown
const statsResult = await loadPlayerStats(2023, { summaryLevel: 'week' });

// Load player stats aggregated for regular season
const regStatsResult = await loadPlayerStats(2023, { summaryLevel: 'reg' });

// Load participation/snap count data
const participationResult = await loadParticipation(2023);

// Load multiple seasons
const multiSeasonPbp = await loadPbp([2022, 2023]);

// Load all available seasons
const allPbp = await loadPbp(true);

// Use Parquet format for better performance
const parquetPbp = await loadPbp(2023, { format: 'parquet' });
```
